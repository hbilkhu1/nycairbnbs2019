Basic data cleaning, exploratory and analysis on Airbnb listings in New York City (2019). 

In terms of exploring and analyzing, we look at a few things:

  1. Airbnb listings that are available and are over the price of $0. There were listings that weren't available through once throughout the year, and listings that were $0. Now a listing can be listed as free (probably not the case), but for the analysis, I wanted to filter them out. 

  2. Average price, broken down by neighbourhood group and room type.

  3. High priced Airbnbs, which is defined as any listing over $1,000.

  4. How available high priced Airbnbs were in the year?
  
  5. If hosts with one than one listing charge more than hosts with just one listing.
  
  6. Data visualizations using ggplot2. 

My first personal project using R. Hope you enjoy!
